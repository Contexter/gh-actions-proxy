### **Problem Description**  

The primary issue we face is **inconsistent implementation of protocol conformance** for handlers and services based on the generated code and OpenAPI specification. Despite having the **server.swift**, **types.swift**, and **openapi.yaml** files, the implementations repeatedly fail to:  

1. **Match the exact protocol signature** specified in `Types.swift`.  
2. **Align with the expected input and output structures** as defined in the OpenAPI schema and reflected in the generated code.  
3. **Handle modularized service layers** in compliance with Vapor conventions while integrating with the generated protocols.  
4. **Avoid repetitive guesswork** about types, initializers, and structures, leading to inefficient debugging and rework cycles.

### **Root Cause Analysis**  

1. **Lack of Explicit Binding to Generated Code**:  
   - While the generated `Types.swift` and `server.swift` define the API structure, the implementation guesses at the expected formats instead of **strictly referencing the generated structures**.  

2. **Unclear Mapping Between OpenAPI and Implementation**:  
   - Input and output parameter definitions from `openapi.yaml` are not consistently checked against the code, leading to mismatches.  

3. **Protocol Signature Enforcement**:  
   - The code assumes behavior that does not match the protocol's strict requirements, resulting in errors like missing initializers or invalid return types.  

4. **Limited Cross-Referencing of Files**:  
   - Despite having all the relevant files, the implementation fails to **leverage them systematically** to derive types, constraints, and logic, relying instead on assumptions.

### **Key Requirements for a Solution**  

We need a **robust and repeatable process** that works for **multiple OpenAPI-based implementations** with the same project setup.  

1. **Precise Protocol Extraction and Analysis**:  
   - Extract definitions from `Types.swift` and `server.swift` upfront and make them **first-class references** during implementation.  

2. **OpenAPI Schema-Driven Mapping**:  
   - Parse the `openapi.yaml` to validate types and endpoints against the generated code.  

3. **Automated Signature Verification**:  
   - Use tools or pre-checks to verify the **function signatures and types** in handlers and services **before attempting implementation**.  

4. **Modular Implementation Templates**:  
   - Define **boilerplate templates** for handlers and services, pre-configured to match Vapor and the OpenAPI structure.  

5. **Iterative Validation Process**:  
   - Implement handlers in **small, verifiable increments** with explicit checks against the generated API structure at each step.

### **Proposed Solution Path**  

1. **Parse and Analyze Existing Files**  
   - Scan the provided files (`server.swift`, `types.swift`, `openapi.yaml`) to build a **reference model** for:  
     - Protocol definitions  
     - Input and output types  
     - Expected structures  

2. **Generate Pre-Validated Stubs**  
   - Use the analyzed data to **generate handler and service stubs** that:  
     - Match the protocol signatures **exactly**.  
     - Use the correct types for inputs and outputs.  

3. **Automate Signature and Type Checks**  
   - Introduce a **validation step** that compares the implementation against the protocol requirements to catch mismatches early.  

4. **Implement Handlers and Services Iteratively**  
   - Develop and test handlers one-by-one, verifying against the schema and generated types after each iteration.  

5. **Template for Future APIs**  
   - Once the first implementation works, **document the process** and create templates that can be reused for other OpenAPI-based projects with similar setups.

### **Immediate Next Step**  

1. **Analyze Protocols in `Types.swift`** to determine the exact structure of input/output requirements.  
2. **Map OpenAPI Definitions** to the generated code to confirm types and paths.  
3. **Regenerate the first handler and service** using this process and test for compliance.  

This approach ensures that the implementation leverages the generated code as **authoritative references** instead of making assumptions, thus eliminating guesswork and errors.
